In this study, we are interested in every pairwise comparison between any two DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). For each comparison, we are interested in the comparative effect on 1) a composite of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism; 2) intracranial bleeding; 3) gastrointestinal bleeding; and 4) all-cause mortality. 

Primary research question: For each comparison between two DOACs, for each of the outcomes of interest, what is the hazard ratio? 
Secondary research question: What is the incidence rate of each outcome of interest in each exposure group?
